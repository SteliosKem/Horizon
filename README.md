# Horizon
A Statically Typed Compiled Language

# Horizon Project
The Horizon Project contains the source code of the horizon language and builds into a static library that can be used anywhere.

# Artemis Project
The Artemis Project compiles into an executable, and is the interface from which you can compile Horizon code, while also acting as a build manager.
